## DAY 64
**Activity:**
Splunk Exploration: Writing Custom SPL and Field Extractions.

**Learning and Outcome:**
- **Active Endpoint Detection:** Wrote SPL to track endpoints active within the last 5 minutes across Linux (`linux_sysmon_xml`) and Windows (`XmlWinEventLog`).
- **Field Extractions:** Configured permanent field extractions in Splunk Settings to normalize `EventID`, `Image`, and `CommandLine` from XML data, replacing the need for repetitive `rex` commands in searches.
- **Optimization:** Reduced SPL complexity and improved search performance by persisting regex logic.

**Technical Note (SPL):**
*List Active Endpoints:*
```splunk
index=* sourcetype IN ("linux_sysmon_xml", "XmlWinEventLog")
| stats latest(_time) AS last_seen BY host
| where now()-last_seen <= 300
| eval last_seen=strftime(last_seen, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| table host last_seen
```
